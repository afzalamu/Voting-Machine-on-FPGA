# Voting-Machine-on-FPGA
This repository showcases a **Simple Voting Machine** implemented on the Nexys A7 FPGA. The project allows casting votes for four candidates (A, B, C, and D) with additional functionalities for resetting and mode switching. The project was developed using Verilog and demonstrates both simulation and hardware implementation results.
